PHP Framework for a REST API
===========================================================
Created by Tommy Crush (http://www.twitter.com/ThomasTommyTom)
===========================================================



Purpose: This is a framework written in PHP [w/ MySQL] that is purposely developed to the point where it is easy to customize it without having to pour over lines of code about what is and is not needed.



This framework:
   - allows POST and GET, and distinguishes between the two
   	- i.e.: A method of 'username' is different with GET and POST
   - allows you to easily declare required parameters, and to return them at the same time
   - allows easy response function
   - built to return both JSON and XML, depending on param 'format' [defaults to json]
   - has the beginnings of oAuth built into it
   - allows different permissions for different functions [see 'requireAuthLevel' below]



Future work on framework:
   - oAuth functionality





##################### To use:#######################
1) Download
2) Change database parameters in api base
3) Run SQL file [explanation below]
4) open 'functions/get.class.php' [this contains the GET functions]
  4a) place custom functions in the API_FUNCTIONS class [use lowercase]
  4b) update $valid_functions with function names
5) repeat with 'functions/post.class.php' [this contains the POST functions]



Take a look at the database structure in order to effectively and efficiently combine the dealt users table with yours. These tables are bare-bone frameworks, so change them as you please.
