PHP Framework for a REST API
===========================================================
Created by Tommy Crush (http://www.twitter.com/ThomasTommyTom)
===========================================================



Purpose: This is a framework written in PHP [w/ MySQL] that is purposely developed to the point where it is easy to customize it without having to pour over lines of code about what is and is not needed.



This framework:
   - allows POST and GET, and distinguishes between the two
   	- i.e.: A method of 'username' is different with GET and POST
   - allows you to easily declare required parameters, and to return them at the same time
   - allows easy response function
   - built to return both JSON and XML, depending on param 'format' [defaults to json]




Future work on framework:
   - oAuth functionality
